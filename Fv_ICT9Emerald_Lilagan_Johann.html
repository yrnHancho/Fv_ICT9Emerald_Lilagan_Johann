	<th>Rottweiler</th>
	<th>The Rottweiler is a sturdy working breed developed from the mastiffs of the Roman legions and is quite strong. Within the confines of the household, the Rottie is a kind playmate and a protector while viewing the outer world with a confident aloofness.</th>

    	<th>Doberman</th>
    	<th>Dobermans are robust, muscular, and compact dogs that stand between 24 and 28 inches tall at the shoulder. The body is streamlined but substantial, and it is coated in a shiny coat that is either black, blue, red, or fawn with rust patterns.</th>

    		<th>Belgian Malinois</th>
            <th>Belgian Malinois are alert, proud, and squarely formed herders that stand between 22 and 26 inches tall. They have a strong, well-muscled appearance that is more graceful than massive, and they have an unpretentious appearance appropriate for dogs bred to work hard for their food. The arrogant way the head is carried is a breed characteristic.</th>

            	<th>The typical American Bully is a medium-sized dog with a blocky head, hefty bones, and a compact, muscular frame. Male canines must be between 17 and 20 inches (43 and 51 cm) and females between 16 and 19 inches (41 to 48 cm).</th>
